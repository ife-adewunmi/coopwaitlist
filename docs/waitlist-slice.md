# Waitlist Redux Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the redesigned waitlist implementation that fully leverages Redux for state management. The previous implementation mixed local component state with Redux, which made it difficult to maintain a consistent state across the application. The new implementation centralizes all waitlist-related state in the Redux store, providing better state persistence, consistency, and developer experience.

## Key Components

### 1. Enhanced waitlistSlice.ts

The heart of the implementation is an enhanced Redux slice that manages:

- Registration form state
- Form validation
- Questionnaire progress
- User answers
- Submission status

Key improvements:
- Combined all waitlist-related state into a single slice
- Added validation logic directly in the slice
- Implemented localStorage persistence for both form and questionnaire data
- Added utility functions for form handling

### 2. Revamped Form Component (waitlist-form-content.tsx)

The form component has been rewritten to:
- Use Redux for all form state
- Validate fields on change/blur
- Show field-specific error messages
- Handle form submission with proper error handling

### 3. Modal Components

Two modal components have been created:

#### waitlist-form-modal.tsx
- Container for the registration form
- Handles modal open/close logic
- Transitions to questionnaire when registration is complete

#### questionnaire-modal.tsx
- Container for the questionnaire component
- Manages completion state and transitions

### 4. Questionnaire Component

A new component for collecting additional user information after registration:
- Step-based progression
- Support for different question types (radio, checkbox, text)
- Progress tracking
- Answer persistence in Redux and localStorage

### 5. WaitlistButton Component

Updated to work with the Redux implementation, allowing users to:
- Open the waitlist modal
- Smoothly scroll to waitlist sections on the page

## Data Flow

1. User clicks WaitlistButton → Opens waitlist-form-modal
2. User completes form → Data saved to Redux → API submission
3. On successful registration → Transition to questionnaire-modal
4. User completes questionnaire → Data saved to Redux
5. Questionnaire completion → Thank you message/next steps

## Benefits of the New Implementation

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All waitlist-related state is now in Redux
2. **Persistence**: Form data and questionnaire progress is saved in localStorage
3. **Improved UX**: Field-level validation and error messages
4. **Better Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript typing throughout
6. **Progressive Experience**: Users can pause and resume the registration process

## Implementation Steps

To implement this new architecture:

1. Replace the existing waitlistSlice.ts with the enhanced version
2. Update the waitlist-form-content.tsx component
3. Modify waitlist-form-modal.tsx to use the Redux state
4. Add the new questionnaire.tsx and questionnaire-modal.tsx components
5. Update waitlist-button.tsx for better integration

## Handling Form Validation

Form validation occurs at multiple levels:

1. **Field-level validation** as the user interacts with each field
2. **Form-level validation** before submission
3. **Server-side validation** via API response

Error handling provides clear feedback to users at each step.

## State Persistence Strategy

The implementation uses localStorage to persist:

1. Form data (under the 'waitlist-form-data' key)
2. Questionnaire progress (under the 'questionnaire-progress' key)

This allows users to return to their progress even if they close the browser.

## Type Definitions

The implementation includes comprehensive TypeScript types for:

- Form field values
- Validation errors
- Questionnaire answers
- Redux actions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:

1. Add more question types to the questionnaire
2. Implement dynamic questionnaire content based on form answers
3. Add analytics tracking for registration funnel
4. Implement A/B testing for different registration flows
5. Add email verification step in the registration process
